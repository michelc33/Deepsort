# DeepSORT Implementation in Python (PyTorch)

This repository contains a Python (PyTorch) implementation of the Deep Simple Online and Realtime Tracking (DeepSORT) algorithm for multi-object tracking.  It aims to replicate the functionality of the original DeepSORT paper, enhancing the basic SORT tracker with deep appearance features for improved robustness in challenging scenarios like occlusions and varying viewpoints.

## Introduction

DeepSORT is a popular multi-object tracking algorithm that combines Kalman filtering for state estimation with a deep learning-based Re-Identification (Re-ID) network to extract appearance features.  These features are used in conjunction with motion information (Mahalanobis distance) and bounding box overlap (IoU) to associate detections with existing tracks, resulting in more accurate and persistent tracking.

This implementation focuses on providing a clear and understandable implementation of DeepSORT using Python and PyTorch, emphasizing modularity and extensibility.

## Features

* **Core DeepSORT Algorithm:** Implements the key components of DeepSORT, including Kalman filtering, Mahalanobis distance gating, appearance feature extraction and matching, IoU-based association, and track management.
* **PyTorch Re-ID Integration:** Leverages PyTorch for the Re-ID network, allowing for easy integration with pre-trained models and customization.  (The original implementation uses a TensorFlow Re-ID network)
* **Multiple Appearance Update Strategies:** Supports Gallery, Exponential Moving Average (EMA), and EMA Gallery methods for updating appearance features.
* **Configurable Parameters:** Provides a flexible configuration system, allowing users to easily adjust parameters like thresholds, weights, and noise levels.
* **Modular Design:** Organized code with clear separation of concerns, making it easier to understand, modify, and extend.
* **Clear Visualization:**  Includes basic visualization capabilities using OpenCV to display tracking results.
* **Dummy Kalman Filter:** While a dummy Kalman filter is provided, it highlights the area where a full Kalman filter implementation using libraries like `filterpy` or similar should be integrated.

## Dependencies

* **Python 3.7+**
* **PyTorch:** `torch`
* **Torchvision:** `torchvision` (for image transforms and potentially loading pre-trained models)
* **NumPy:** `numpy`
* **OpenCV:** `cv2` (for video I/O and visualization)
* **SciPy:** `scipy` (specifically `scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment` for the Hungarian algorithm)
* **[Optional] `filterpy` or similar (for a full Kalman filter implementation)**

To install the required dependencies, you can use pip:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision numpy opencv-python scipy
#If you need a Kalman Filter library (optional, but recommended):
#pip install filterpy
```

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/DeepSORT-Python.git  # Replace with your repo URL
    cd DeepSORT-Python
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies (see [Dependencies](#dependencies) section above).**

3.  **Download a pre-trained Re-ID network:**

    *   This implementation requires a pre-trained Re-ID network to extract appearance features.  You'll need to download a suitable model (e.g., a ResNet-based model trained on a person re-identification dataset).  The `download_reid_resnet()` function in the code provides a placeholder for this process.  **Replace the placeholder with the appropriate download logic and specify the correct path to your downloaded model.**
    *   The `personReIDResNet_v2.pth` model name is a suggestion, adapt the code to your specific naming.

## Usage

1.  **Prepare your video and detections:**

    *   Provide the path to your video file in the `video_path` variable in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.
    *   Generate object detections for each frame of your video.  The expected format for detections is a list of dictionaries, where each dictionary contains the following keys:
        *   `'bbox'`:  Bounding box in `[x, y, width, height]` format.
        *   `'score'`:  Confidence score of the detection.
    *   Save the detections to a file (e.g., a pickle file or a `.pth` file compatible with `torch.load`) and provide the path to the file in the `detections_path` variable.
    *   The dummy detection creation routine in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block provides an example of the expected format.

2.  **Run the tracker:**

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

    *   This will run the DeepSORT tracker on your video, displaying the results in a window.  Press `q` to exit.

3.  **Customize parameters (optional):**

    *   You can adjust the tracker's parameters by modifying the `DeepSORT` class initialization in the `if __name__ == "__main__":` block.  See the docstrings for each parameter for more information.

## Implementation Details

*   **Kalman Filter:**  A dummy Kalman filter is provided as a placeholder.  You **must** replace this with a proper Kalman filter implementation using a library like `filterpy` or by implementing your own Kalman filter logic.  The Kalman filter is used to predict the future state of each track and to smooth the track's trajectory.
*   **Re-ID Network:** The Re-ID network is used to extract appearance features from each detection.  These features are used to calculate the cosine distance between detections and existing tracks.
*   **Matching Cascade:** The matching cascade is a hierarchical assignment process that prioritizes tracks that have been updated recently. This helps to prevent ID switches.
*   **Cost Matrix:** The cost matrix combines Mahalanobis distance, cosine distance, and IoU to determine the cost of assigning each detection to each track.
*   **Assignment:** The Hungarian algorithm (implemented using `scipy.optimize.linear_sum_assignment`) is used to find the optimal assignment between detections and tracks.
